**/dcrdesign** repo has been created with the intent of scaling the design output, maintaining consistency, accessibility and organisation. Current functions are following: 

- Communicating DCR design contributors current tasks and forming high level overviews (using Gh’s built-in pm features). 
- - The discipline can be largely broken down by identity, major programs/products and general visual communications.
- Coordinating work and syncing up with other designers. 
- Posting deliverables and reports to root archiving. 
- Providing a central location for cross-referencing design related issues or questions through-out the ecosystem.
- Accepting and reviewing requests.

### Use Practice: 
- Use Slack and Matrix design and projects ops channels for quick and temporary communications and general discussions around work. (#design /#_ops)
- Post selfs tasks and projects for coordination on the relevant `project boards`
- When posting a new item, start with an `Issue` or `Note` on relevant `project board`. When the item is in progress, define it’s details by making it into an `issue`. 
- When doing confidential work, post the published result into the `Completed board` and document it within an `issue` (e.g. short delivery report, preview, links, work files or assets).
- Post delivery reports, assets and other references as `comments` within `issues`. 
- Use `labels` and to create better visibility and organisation between `issues`

If you are working on visual, motion design or illustration tasks for use in general visual communication (e.g. promotion, marketing, instructions…) – using only /dcrdesign repo and Slack/Matrix will cover most of the productivity needs.

If you are working on UI/UX side of different Decred Platforms/Products – both the relevant products repositories and /dcrdesign should be regular tools of productivity. While different product repos have various use practices, levels organisation and activity, the /dcrdesign's role is to bring clarity between a general design direction and how it’s applied across the products. It's recommended to post all important design developments and deliverables with sufficient descriptions to /dcrdesign for archiving. 

Different teams have nuances in their approaches, as one rule of thumb, needless double posting should be avoided as much. Use /dcrdesign as a detailed point of reference for: references, assets, etc and refer to issues posted in this repo. This way future projects and their participants will have an easier time understanding what’s what. 

### Next steps
This repo can be currently looked as a stepping stone towards building a functional design system and remote open-source work practice. The groundwork requires working further into designers practices of using gh, recollecting and organising various assets, component libraries, practice guides and standards as well completing critical design developments in key platforms. The framework for the system will be hosted here.
